Additional functions:
is_in_wrong_guess_lst-a function that gets a word and a list of wrong guesses,
 and checks whether this word contains a letter from the list of wrong guesses

is_letters_match- a function that gets a word and a pattern, and checks
 if the letters in the pattern match the letters in the word.
 assuming they have the same length

check_common_letter_not_in_pattern - a function that gets a list of
 counters(related to letters), and a pattern, returns the letter with
 the maximal counter, excluding pattern letters

(provided)-
letter_to_index - return the index of the given letter in an alphabet list
index_to_letter - return the letter corresponding to the given index

section C - q1:
("chocolate", "ch_c_late", "o")-two equal letters in word+ completing the word
("bottle", "bo__le", "t")-two equal letters repeat one after the other in word
("extraordinary", "_____________", "x")-not even one letter in word revealed
("computer", "co_put__", "k")- the letter doesn't appear in word.
pattern should not change

section C-q2:
If we want to play the game with hebrew letters and hebrew words,
we need to change A_B_C variable to contain the hebrew alphabet, to change
LETTERS_IN_ALPHABET to number of letters in hebrew alphabet (22),
to change words.txt to contain hebrew words, to define "CHAR_A = 97" to match
hebrew letter index, to take into consideration the final form letters
in hebrew - deciding whether they are completely different letters from their
"normal" form or not, and if the player guesses a letter that has a final form,
it will be also considered as guessing the final form
