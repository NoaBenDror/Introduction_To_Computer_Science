==================
this exercise includes some functions that use loops, lists, input from user.
======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================
Additional functions:

is_cyclic_from_index (to cyclic function) - a function that gets two lists,
and shift, and checks whether the second list is cyclic shift of
the first list, with this specific shift.
assumptions: the lists have equal length, shift_lst2<length

does_it_have_seven (to seven_boom function) - a function that
gets an int type number and checks if it has the digit 7 in it


the chosen edge cases on test_maximum_func function:

empty list - should return None (and not 0)
list [0] - a list with one element
list [5, 5, 5] - a list with elements that have the same value
list [7, 3, -15, 34, -25, 93] - a longer list, the last element is the maximal


Part 5 - Theoretical questions:

1. TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len() -
   the inputs are not of type list
2. -1
3. TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str' -
   it means the function can't compare string type and int type values-
   for example, can't check which is maximal between 100 and 'intro'
4. [0, 1, 1]
5. []
6. [[0,2], [0,2], [1,1]] - the same pair repeats because the assumption
   that each number appears not more than once did not exist
