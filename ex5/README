this exercise implements search word game - finding words inside matrix
of letters in specified directions

Additional functions:
does_word_match_index - a function that gets a word, matrix of letters,
                        row index, column index and a search direction,
                        and checks whether the word matches that index in
                        the matrix

does_len_match_index - a function that checks if match is possible considering
                       the word's length only. if it's outside the matrix -
                       the word would surely not match

build_letter_to_indices - a function that gets matrix of letters and returns a
                          dictionary: key = letter, value = list of row,column
                          in which the letter appears

update_dict_with_word - a function that gets a word and a current dictionary
                        of word to occurrences, and adds the word to the
                        dictionary if it does not exist, or adds 1 to the
                        occurrences if it exists

filter_directions - a function that gets string of letters that represent
                    the search directions, checks if some letters appear more
                    than once,and returns filtered string, so that each letter
                    will appear only once

process_word_search_in_matrix - a function that gets list of strings, each
                      string represents a parameter - names of files which
                      contain list of words, matrix of letters, search
                      directions, and an output file.(if the parameters are
                      valid) the function will write the results into the
                      output file


The tested function in 'check_wordsearch.py' is 'does_len_match_index'
(actually also checks DIRECTION_TO_MOVEMENT)-
(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, "u") - letter length is 1, matrix 1X1 - should return True
(5, 1, 1, 0, 0, "u") - same as one above, letter length is 5 - should return
 False
(7, 6, 9, 1, 2, "r") - fits exactly until edge of matrix - should return True
(3, 5, 5, 2, 2, direction) - square matrix, checking match from middle index
- should return True in all directions
(4, 5, 5, 2, 2, direction) - square matrix, checking match from middle index
- should return False in all directions
