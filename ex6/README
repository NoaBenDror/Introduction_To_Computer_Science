==================
this exercise works with audio wav files. The user has a few options
to choose from - changing file, uniting files, and composing a melody.

======================
Each menu has a function of its own. The main menu leads to other menus
(according to user's choice), and each inner menu leads eventually to
transition menu - in which the user has the option to change file or save it.

If the user chose to change file - each change has it's own function.
If the user chose to unite 2 files - there is a main function for the union,
which calls helper functions. These helper functions unite the 2 audio data
lists, and match the sample rate to united file sample rate.
If the user chose to compose a melody - there is a main function for the
composition. This function has a helper function which composes each note.
